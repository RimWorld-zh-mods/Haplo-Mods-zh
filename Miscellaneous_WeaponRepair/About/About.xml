   Are your best weapons always in an awful condition, with no way to repair them?
   Do you have multiple less quality weapons of the same kind just laying around, doing nothing for you?
   Rejoice, now you can use spare parts from your low quality weapons of the same kind to repair your legendaries!
   --- Needed mechanic table and skills not included ---
